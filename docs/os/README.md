# AI Engineering OS

A system of rules, boundaries, contracts, documentation and deterministic guardrails that
lets **several teams and their AI agents develop in parallel** without generation speed
blowing up complexity.

---

## The problem this OS solves

Agents make writing code nearly free. Three costs do not come down:

1. **Understanding** — somebody still has to know what the system does.
2. **Verification** — somebody still has to review and validate.
3. **Coordination** — several teams have to move without blocking each other.

A generation accelerator plugged into a system without boundaries does not produce a
faster project: it produces an unreadable project faster.

This OS therefore treats **cognitive load**, **review capacity** and **inter-team
coupling** as the project's three scarce resources, and organises everything else around
preserving them.

## The five structuring ideas

| # | Idea | Practical consequence |
|---|------|----------------------|
| 1 | **The prompt is a transit zone, not a residence** | Every automatable rule moves down into CI and leaves the prompt |
| 2 | **The module is the unit of parallelism** | One PR = one module; two modules know each other only through a contract |
| 3 | **The oracle before the generation** | The criterion is made executable before the first line is written |
| 4 | **Convention is the default choice** | It needs no justification; every deviation does |
| 5 | **No stack is imposed** | The OS imposes a selection method, not a list of technologies |

## Navigation map

### What to read, depending on who you are

| You are… | Read, in order |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **An AI agent** | `AGENTS.md` (kernel) + the module's local `AGENTS.md` + the triggered playbooks |
| **A new developer** | `00-overview.md` → `02-modules.md` → `05-workflow.md` |
| **A tech lead / architect** | `00-overview.md` → `02` → `03` → `07` |
| **A product owner** | `00-overview.md` → `06-decisions.md` |
| **Whoever creates the project** | The project's `README.md`, then `09-platform.md` |

## How to read these documents

The documents in `docs/` are **the reference**: they explain, justify and detail. They
are **not** meant to be loaded into an agent's context.

What an agent loads is:

- `AGENTS.md` (the kernel, always);
- the `AGENTS.md` of the module concerned (always);
- one or more `playbooks/` (only when triggered).

If you need to put a rule in the kernel, re-read `07-governance.md` § "Where does this
rule live?" first. The answer is very often "in CI", not "in the prompt".

## Status

This OS is subject to its own rules: it evolves in small steps, its structuring changes
get an ADR, and every rule it contains is a candidate for automation. See
`docs/10-measurement.md` § "Improving the OS".
